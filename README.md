Spam E-mails Classification using NLP
classification text project using nlp 
Spam-E-mails-Classification-using-NLP is a machine learning project that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify emails as spam or not spam. The project is implemented using Python and various NLP libraries such as TfidfVectorizer,  scikit-learn , matplotlib and seaborn to visuilze data and confusion_matrix. The project involves several steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and model evaluation. The data used in the project is a collection of emails that have been labeled as spam or not spam. The preprocessing step involves cleaning the email text, removing stop words, and converting the text to lowercase. The feature extraction step involves extracting relevant features from the email text, such as the frequency of certain words, the presence of certain phrases, and the overall sentiment of the email. The model training step involves training a machine learning model to classify the emails based on the extracted features. The model used in the project is a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which is a popular algorithm for classification tasks. The model is trained on a portion of the labeled data and then evaluated on a separate portion of the data to assess its accuracy. The project is implemented as a Python script that can be run on a local machine or a cloud-based platform such as Google Colab. The script takes as input a file containing the email text and outputs a prediction for each email, indicating whether it is spam or not spam. The repository contains the Python script, the data files, and any additional documentation or resources needed to run the project.
